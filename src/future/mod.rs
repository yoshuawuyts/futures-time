//! Asynchronous values.

//! # Cancellation
//!
//! Futures can be cancelled by dropping them before they finish executing. This
//! is useful when we're no longer interested in the result of an operation, as
//! it allows us to stop doing needless work. This also means that a future may cancel at any `.await` point, and so just
//! like with `?` we have to be careful to roll back local state if our future
//! halts there.
//!
//! In order to perform a cancellation remotely, you can use the [`channel::bounded`]
//! function to create a sender/receiver pair. When the sender side of
//! this pair emits a message, all receivers are trigered. Receivers can be passed to
//! [`Future::timeout`] or [`Stream::timeout`] to perform a cancellation when
//! the message is received.
//!
//! [`channel::bounded`]: crate::channel::bounded
//! [`Future::timeout`]: crate::future::FutureExt::timeout
//! [`Stream::timeout`]: crate::stream::StreamExt::timeout
//!
//!
//! ```
//! use futures_lite::prelude::*;
//! use futures_time::prelude::*;
//! use futures_time::channel;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     async_io::block_on(async {
//!         let (send, mut recv) = channel::bounded::<()>(1); // create a new send/receive pair
//!         let mut counter = 0;
//!         let value = async { "meow" }
//!             .delay(Duration::from_millis(100))
//!             .timeout(recv.next()) // time-out if the sender is dropped.
//!             .await;
//!
//!         assert_eq!(value.unwrap(), "meow");
//!     })
//! }
